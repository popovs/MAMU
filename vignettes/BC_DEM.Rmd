# Download British Columbia Digital Elevation Model data

The province of British Columbia has two digital elevation model (DEM) datasets [available on their website](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services/topographic-data/elevation/digital-elevation-model) for download. The 25m resolution gridded Canadian Digital Elevation Data (CDED) format DEM is free, but it's [fairly complicated to get](https://pub.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/175624/) user-friendly data - the user must first determine which DEM map tile they wish to download, download each strip of the tile as a zipped file, unzip all the strips, and stitch the strip together into a single usable DEM raster file. The `BC_DEM()` function automates this entire process for you. Simply specify the map tile you wish to download and the function will take care of everything else for you.

## Determine map tile to download

The map tiles available for download correspond to the [BC Maps & Orthos](https://a100.gov.bc.ca/ext/mtec/public/products/mapsheet) tiles. At the moment, `BC_DEM` only supports downloading one map tile at a time.
